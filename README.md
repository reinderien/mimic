# mimic
*[ab]using Unicode to create tragedy*

### Introduction

mimic provokes:
- fun
- frustration
- curiosity
- murderous rage

It's inspired by this terrible idea floating around:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">MT: Replace a semicolon (;) with a greek question mark (Í¾) in your friend&#39;s C# code and watch them pull their hair out over the syntax error</p>&mdash; Peter Ritchie (@peterritchie) <a href="https://twitter.com/peterritchie/status/534011965132120064">November 16, 2014</a></blockquote>

There are many more characters in the Unicode character set that look, to some extent or another, like others -  homographs. Mimic substitutes common ASCII characters for obscure homographs.

Fun games to play with mimic:
- Pipe some source code through and see if you can find all of the problems
- Pipe someone else's source code through without telling them
- Be fired, and then killed

### Example usage

```
./mimic --list           # Show all of the homographs
./mimic --explain=o      # What crazy things can we do with this letter?
./mimic --me-harder 100  # Type some lines in and mess with every single char
./mimic --reverse        # Undo the mayhem. Boooring.
cat mimic | ./mimic      # Pipe the source through itself at 1%

# Turn up the knob and save the results
cat mimic | ./mimic --me-harder 25 > mimicked

# Or, if your code acts strange, but you have seen this prank before:
cat mimicked | ./mimic --reverse > unmimicked
diff unmimicked mimicked
```

### Results

Observe the mayhem:

*"BUT WHY?"*

Or, if you've been mimicked a little harder,
